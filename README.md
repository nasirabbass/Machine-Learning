## Dataset

### **Source**
The **Iris Dataset** is a classic dataset in machine learning, included in Scikit-learn's built-in datasets.

### **Features**
| Feature Name      | Description                     |
|-------------------|---------------------------------|
| Sepal length (cm) | Sepal length of the flower      |
| Sepal width (cm)  | Sepal width of the flower       |
| Petal length (cm) | Petal length of the flower      |
| Petal width (cm)  | Petal width of the flower       |

### **Target**
The target variable represents the species of Iris flowers:
- **Setosa**
- **Versicolor**
- **Virginica**

## Methodology

### **1. Data Exploration**
- Load and convert the Iris dataset into a DataFrame for better readability.
- Check for missing values and review basic dataset statistics.
- Preview the data structure and understand class labels.

### **2. Baseline Model**
- Train a baseline **Random Forest Classifier** with default parameters.
- Evaluate the performance using:
  - Accuracy
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Classification Report

### **3. Hyperparameter Tuning**
- Use **GridSearchCV** to identify the best hyperparameters:
  - Number of estimators (`n_estimators`)
  - Maximum depth (`max_depth`)
  - Minimum samples per split (`min_samples_split`)
  - Minimum samples per leaf (`min_samples_leaf`)
- Train the optimized model and compare its performance with the baseline model.

### **4. Feature Importance Analysis**
- Analyze the relative importance of each feature in predicting the target variable.
- Visualize feature importance using bar charts.

### **5. Decision Boundary Visualization**
- Visualize decision boundaries in 2D using two selected features.
- Understand how the Random Forest model classifies data points.

### **6. Model Evaluation**
- Compare the baseline and optimized Random Forest models using metrics like:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - Class-specific performance metrics for Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.
